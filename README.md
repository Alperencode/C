<h2>Repository Description</h2>
<p>
This repository created when i decided to learn c programming language.
The reason why im learning C is because in my university's syllabus we will use C.
So for me, I have to be a few steps ahead from my university.
10 days left until my school starts and i'll probably finish all the basics in 1 or 2 day so i can learn OOP in C and make little projects in the remaining days.

<h2>What will be in this repository?</h2>
<p>
As i mentioned in description it'll be basics in 1 or 2 days and then i'll learn OOP in C and try to make little projects using C and i'll be posting them here.
